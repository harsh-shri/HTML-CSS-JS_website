            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and
                implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to
                the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state
                governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as
                large as India, now with 28 states and seven union territories, this means that the potential for
                variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is
                vast.Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
                state-level programs and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of
                primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.
                Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53%
                and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India's improved education system is often cited as
                one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher
                education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in
                higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of
                26.3% in 2019,[13] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education
                enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to
                continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.In 2005-6 83.13% of
                schools offering elementary education (Grades 1-8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were
                under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the
                Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one
                third are ‘aided’ and two thirds are ‘unaided’. Enrolment in Grades 1-8 is shared between government and
                privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of
                higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded
                a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of
                particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential
                quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest
                university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were
                taught in Ariano -Páli language.Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These
                institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.</p>
